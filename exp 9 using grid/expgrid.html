    advantages of grid
1. Two-Dimensional Layouts: CSS Grid is designed for creating two-dimensional layouts, allowing for more complex and flexible designs compared to Flexbox, which is primarily one-dimensional.
2. Explicit Positioning: Grid allows for explicit placement of items within the grid, giving developers
more control over the layout.
3. Overlapping Items: CSS Grid supports overlapping grid items, enabling creative design possibilities that are
not easily achievable with Flexbox.
4. Simplified Alignment: Grid provides powerful alignment capabilities for both rows and columns, making it easier to center and align items within the grid.
5. Responsive Design: CSS Grid makes it easier to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

GRID TERMANOLOGY
1. Grid Line:It is made up of lines which run vertically and horizontally across the grid.
The lines that define the start and end of rows and columns in a grid layout.
2. Grid Track: The space between two adjacent grid lines, representing a row or column.
row track and column track
row track- horizontal space between two horizontal grid lines
column track- vertical space between two vertical grid lines
grid cell- the space between four grid lines, representing the intersection of a row and a column.
grid area- a rectangular area defined by four grid lines, which can span multiple rows and columns.
grid gap- the space between grid items, defined using the grid-gap property.
grid container- the parent element that contains grid items and is defined using the display: grid; property.
-->

<!-- grid item - the child elements within a grid container that are positioned and sized according to the grid layout.
 
make a grid container
.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
    gap: 20px;
    padding: 20px;
}
    defining columns
grid-template-columns: 200px 200px 200px ;
this line defines three columns, each with a fixed width of 200px.
This line defines the columns of the grid. It uses the repeat() function to create as many columns as will fit in the container (auto-fit), with each column having a minimum width of 250px and a maximum width of 1fr (fraction of available space).
